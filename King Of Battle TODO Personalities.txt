Kamikaze: This tank seeks out the player at all times, does not fire. This tanks sole goal is to get within range of the player and explode,
causing severe damage. Only when the player is within range does it explode, destroying the tank does not explode the tank. Destroys itself
 upon explosion.

Guerilla: This tank will shoot once upon seeing the player, and then retreat to a different waypoint. Rinse and repeat. 

Coward: This tank will, upon seeing the player, immediately flee to the direction of another tank, not fighting back until another
tank is engaging the player as well.

Artillery: This tank will stay further away than other tanks, and fire from a longer distance. Artillery tanks will have further sight data.
